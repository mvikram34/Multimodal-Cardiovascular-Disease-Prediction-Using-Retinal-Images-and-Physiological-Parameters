# Multimodal Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

## Using Retinal Images and Physiological Parameters

This repository contains the code and resources for a novel machine learning project that predicts the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) by integrating two distinct data sources: **retinal fundus images** and **traditional physiological parameters**. This multimodal approach aims to create a more accurate and robust prediction model than could be achieved using either data type alone.

### Introduction ðŸ©º

Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death globally, making early and accurate detection a critical challenge. The eye's retina offers a unique, non-invasive window into the body's vascular health. By analyzing features in retinal imagesâ€”such as the width, tortuosity, and branching patterns of blood vesselsâ€”we can identify early signs of systemic vascular distress that are linked to CVD.

This project enhances this "oculomics" approach by fusing retinal image data with key physiological measurements (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol levels, BMI) to build a comprehensive, holistic predictive model.

### Key Features

  * **Multimodal Fusion:** Combines deep learning on retinal images with machine learning on tabular physiological data.
  * **End-to-End Pipeline:** Includes scripts for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
  * **Interpretability:** Implements techniques to visualize and understand which features (both from images and physiological data) are most influential in the model's predictions.
  * **Modular Code:** The codebase is organized and well-commented to facilitate understanding and future development.

### Methodology

The project follows a two-pronged approach that is later fused for the final prediction:

1.  **Retinal Image Analysis:**

      * A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, such as ResNet or VGG, is trained on a dataset of retinal fundus images.
      * The model learns to extract critical vascular features indicative of cardiovascular risk.
      * Image preprocessing steps include quality assessment, normalization, and segmentation of blood vessels.

2.  **Physiological Data Analysis:**

      * A separate model (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest) is trained on structured physiological data.
      * This dataset includes parameters like:
          * Age and gender
          * Systolic and diastolic blood pressure
          * Total cholesterol and HDL/LDL levels
          * Body Mass Index (BMI)
          * Smoking status
          * History of diabetes

3.  **Model Fusion:**

      * The outputs or intermediate feature vectors from both models are combined using a fusion technique (e.g., concatenation, weighted averaging).
      * This fused representation is then fed into a final classification layer to predict the likelihood of a cardiovascular event.

### Dataset

This project was developed using the [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) dataset, which contains a rich collection of retinal images and corresponding health records. Due to data privacy restrictions, the dataset cannot be shared directly. However, the code is structured to be easily adaptable to other public datasets like [DIARETDB1](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.it.lut.fi/project/imret/diaretdb1/) or your own custom datasets.

-----

### Future Work

  * Explore more advanced fusion strategies for combining the data modalities.
  * Incorporate other data types, such as genetic markers or electronic health records (EHR).
  * Deploy the trained model as a web application for real-time risk assessment.
